# Predicting-Football-Matches
Third year University undergraduate project, predicting football matches using machine learning.

Model.py is the model used, with training, evalution and testing data splits.

dataset.csv is the bespoke datset, created for this project.

Dataset Combination.py was used to create this final dataset and includes some correlation analysis, important for feature selection.

Along with my written report, graded as a First (76%).
